# Web stack debugging #2 :computer:

This was the third in a series of web stack debugging projects. In these
projects, I was given broken/bugged webstacks in isolated containers,
and tasked with fixing the web stack to a working state.

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. Run software as another user**
  * [0-iamsomeonelese](./0-iamsomeonelese): Bash script that runs the command
  `whoami` under the user passed as argument.
  * Usage: `./0-iamsomeonelese <user>`

* **1. Run Nginx as Nginx**
  * [1-run_nginx_as_nginx](./1-run_nginx_as_nginx): Bash script that fixes a
  web server to run Nginx listening on port `8080` as the `nginx` user.
