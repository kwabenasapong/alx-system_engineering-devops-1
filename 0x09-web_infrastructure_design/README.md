# Web infrastructure design :computer:

This was a one-week project in which I started researching the design of the web infrastructure. While researching the different design principles, I drew on the whiteboard diagrams of a developing web infrastructure applying concepts such as **LAMP**, **firewall**, **Load Balencer**, **protocols** (HTTP and HTTPS), **SSL** certifications.
