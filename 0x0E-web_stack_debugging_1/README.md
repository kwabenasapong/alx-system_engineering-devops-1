# Web stack debugging #1 :computer:

This was the second in a series of web stack debugging projects. In these
projects, I was given broken/bugged webstacks in isolated containers,
and tasked with fixing the web stack to a working state.

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. Nginx likes port 80**
  * [0-nginx_likes_port_80](./0-nginx_likes_port_80): Bash script that
  configures Nginx to run and listen to port 80 on all of a server's active IPv4's.
